# SharedTodo

This is a simple demo for usage of Phoenix Channels with Preact & Typescript.
The app allows multiple visitors to edit the todo list simultaneously in realtime.

## Getting Started

To get the app running:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
